Parser is generated via the online generator found at pegjs.org/online. 

The grammer file terra_grammar.pegjs is entered there, and then a parser is 
downloaded and named terra_parser.js. After downloading the grammar, I copy the 
contents into parse.js, in the "GENERATED BY PEGJS" section. I also change the
parser from a self-invoking method into a normal function declaration 
"buildParser()" -- this includes removing the method invocation at the end.

Another possible approach is to reference peg.js source and build my own, but 
since for now, I like developing the grammar interactively, I having the grammar
pre-compiled is fine.
